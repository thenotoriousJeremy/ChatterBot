Holy shit. That loot council is fucking gold
I'm dying laughing
Wait shiiiitttt is Robby back?
Did they tell you that Chromag dropped double Dragonstalker and the xbow when Kyle ran it
Haha and I'm only back for the memes
And to roast my brother when he streams
Hahahah damn
We're losing Dan to change of command as well
Fucking army holding back the leveling
Wait did Kyle get any of those items?
Also this weekend I'm going to go hard and hit 60 Robby and start learning some of the mage one pulls
got the shoulders and i got the nef head
I'll be able to boost anyone or alts that need it
Fuck yeahhhhh dude
You getting the PvP neck or ring?
ring I think is better
Hondadays getting thicc
real thicccccc
Ehhh ring gets replaced in AQ real fast
And I think zg set rings are better
PvP neck lasts a long time
But if it's a huge upgrade for you now the ring is nuts
I already have the ZF boost down which covers like 42 to 50. Going to work on Mara and zg
I'm definitely gonna come calling for those boosts... Cambridge is still chilling at 41 haha
If I can learn and put in time for Mara I could boost you to like 50 in a day
Although they have the new instance cap
And then going to learn the zg boosts to get you from 50 to 60
luke what's the benefit of the neck in pvp? is the +7 defense that good?
Insane stamina
Honestly I prefer only neck over it.
Ring is probably just better for you
kyle just got the ol wombo combo
rok and lok
your boy is thiccccccc now
YOOOOOOOOOO
you got the sinew first run?
my little hunter is growing up so fast
sure did.
rolled a 33 on those bitches

How'd BWL go last night lads? Any good loot for our car boys?
No loot. Solid 3 hour clear.
"Actually, I got a belt but it's not anything really great"
Which belt?
I've gotta live vicariously through you all
lost out on my judgement chest to another pally. they took it for heals when it aint even good for heals
sad
also lost the roll on Herald of Woe (super cool mace) to a brand new pally
sad
good clear though
"Therazane's Link +12 int, +22 stam, +12 spirit 1%crit and +44 atk power"
Thus is the cycle of wow. Only sadness and losing rolls
pretty decent
Links belt isn't bad at all if you don't have 8/8 t1 or t2
yeah I won it with a solid 35
Robby whenever I'm not working 12+ hour days I can boost you

You go to the study room table to call an emergency meeting and Garrett yells crisis alert over the speakers when an imposter sabotages something.

"nice, jeremy. Is this what you're spending your last two weeks at FLW doing?"
"Name your date, I'm ready to play"
"Robby, have you been fired yet?"
No 15-6 yet
Whenever you guys want. The character creator is not as good as dndbeyond
whoever made the PHB for this did a really great job
I'm reading through it and it reads very similarly to the real PHB for 5e
It's essentially word for word transcribed and 'translated'
"yeah, it has a shit ton of species for character creation"
I'm about to learn a lot about the SW universe
"Jeremy, are you still in MO, or did you go to KY to drop your stuff off?"
MO. Laying on the couch. On season 7 of GoT and burned 20ish pizza boxes.
sounds like a good weekend
Why not just play the already built SW FFG? My group uses Roll20 for it.
The mechanics are super clunky compared to 5e
Ohh but they got 5e version on roll20!
Yeah the success/advantage/threat/etc is a little less straight forward than straight numbers. My GM seems to almost completely disregard our rolls aside from basic suggestion of what happenes.
Zg is the bane of my existance

GTFO.
I'll watch expanse watch party jeremy. Im wfh now so nothing fuckin matters
I got all the time in the world
I'll go to Starbucks.
Also Sturgis is an absolute covid hot spot. Like thousands of folks got it.
"You see how trump intentionally politicized the issue, to downplay it. And admitted as such on tape. And nobody cares"
"I don't have work until next month, I'll probs watch it today"
the first three episodes of S2 were bangers
"What's sad is that viruses like COVID effect the elderly (i.e. Trump supporters) more than other parts of the population, but none of that is my business."
"But whats absolutelt bonkers is how much sway president trump possesses currently. He's completely infallible to a large majority of his supporters. It truly blows my mind. I think about his quote regarding shooting someone on Broadway and noone would care. And honest to God, i think he's right"
"there's an infrastructure of demure sycophants who would be falling over themselves to defend his actions, it's kinda gross. He has some wild cult of personality, but I don't really see his allure. Not to point where all these boomers base their whole existence off of him. Trump is like Apple, he's a lifestyle brand..."
My dad thinks he's the best businessman to have existed and cites all of his actions as being business based. He excuses his actions because of that.
"I think a lot of it is thinking that if the president acts like that, it's also acceptable to act that way. My dad is pretty racist and anything that normalizes that behavior is good to him"
It's fucking wild though. I never thought I would see an individual get away with doing the things that trump has
Its super disheartening to me though. Especially as a second ammendment supporter
"Like I figure myself pretty independent, and I find the actions of the the extreme left and right both repugnant, but it seems too me so much of the radical right has seeped into the mainstream republican party"
"And too see so many people who at some point have stated the importance of the 2A to be able to fight back against a harsh and tyrannical government, only to turn and around and support a tyrannical government....like what kind of Olympics level mental gymnastics is that"
"dude, the democratic party is right of center on the political compass if anything and the people who the republicans are calling ""extreme leftists"" are barely left of center. Like they want people to have free healthcare, education, and a living wage - they don't want to expropriate all property and redistribute it equally among the citizens of the United States. And when I talk about raising minimum wage people often rebut it with fears of hyperinflation and the cost of living rising dramatically but the US government gives billions of dollars to corporations and nobody blinks an eye. Like is it so much to ask that people are able to live well, get an education if they want it and be able to see a doctor when they're sick? I guess it is."
"regardless though, the democratic party and the republican party are both cancer. There needs to be another option"
"""Social welfare policies are only acceptable if given to corporations though."" - Fox News, probably"
"Actually, Fox News is like hyper fear-mongering cancer and this is the needle in the arm for so many elderly people. They want their audience to be afraid of their children and grandchildren, it's nuts."
"We need some socio-economic reform in this country. The wealth inequality is getting pretty drastically out of hand. We're at 1880s/1890s levels of wealth inequality. In the 1900-1930s progressive era, the United States had two choices: Marxism or developing a social safety net. We developed a comprehensive set of institutions to protect people's livelihoods, enable corporations to continue to innovate by disrupting monopolistic ambitions, and foster the distribution of wealth through free markets restrained by ethical policies. The result? We attracted the best and brightest from all over the world, won two world wars, and created the strongest and largest middle class in the history of the world."
"It wasn't perfect, it won't be perfect in the future either, but we are so reticent to advance our governmental processes and economics into the 21st century that we will be left behind. We are stuck in the 1930s, maybe 1970s economically and the 1960s socially. I don't mean to speak in absolutes here, but the enemies of free speech and democracy are gathering strength each and every day. We have to be ready to respond, not always by force, but by proving to the people of the world that the American way of liberty and justice for all is ""the way."""

I watched all of Chernobyl yesterday. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
It's an outstanding series
I appreciate they could simplify it enough for me to understand
probably one of the best videos I've seen on reactor theory in the last episode
"""at least 25,000 mW's....."""
Holy fuck
"one of the biggest issues? the Soviets didn't bother to make a civilian power generation reactor design and a military purpose Plutonium breeder design. Graphite moderated reactors are just way worse for generating power because they don't have any passive cooling, but they are excellent for breeding Plutonium from Uranium"
And then they tried to sink the graphite tipped rods back in.... Jesus fuck. That's been my best tv show experience since breaking bad
"the free exchange of scientific information, so important"

are you guys still playing?
let's go to the hypnotic disc and hop in the raid channel
"boys guess who got Ashhre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting and Dragonstalker Greaves in one BWL"
it was a big night
Oh hellllllll yeah
That's my boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLav0zMHut8
Hell yeah Kyle welcome to the big boys club!
I'm next in line for cts or ancient qiraji ripper. Ima dps like a real boy
skip CTS go AQR
jk both awesome take what you can get
Hows AQ going for you guys? Full clear yet for R2?
Just downed cthun last night. Still haven't done ouro or visc
oof
visc going to be an issue if you dont all have good NR or engi
I mean i got an ok ammount. Not a ton. But a decent amount
I think I got like 5 more weeks then I can probably play the mage a little bit a gain
What are you going for t2.5 set?
nah 2.5 is garbage on the hunter
Only piece worth a damn is the chest and Im about like a month or two before hunters can get it
"im done with loot until naxx pretty much. got my ring and jom gabber, only piece left is 2.5 chest"
good old like 6/7 months of 2 pieces of loot. Just the hunter life
I think Kyle is learning that lesson as well...
"Yeah AQ is horrible for a hunter, you just skip a whole raid tier"
long road until naxx
Im filling the void with my warrior
"just calculated, 5 weeks after this weekend and I can probably play the mage with yall again"
Neat. Hopefully a sword drops between now and then lol
come see me in the BGs

"Yo Dan and Kyle - Raid 2 is probably coming to a swift end soon because Hilli, Vielyn, myself, Abian, and Brewski are probably all leaving. Not because of anything R2 has or hasn't done, but because of some new developments with Deezy. I can explain all in person later but I wanted to give you a heads up because R2 will be pretty crippled once we leave. We are all most likely going to a new team forming in Inconceivable and I just wanted to give you a heads up about that so you don't have to deal with the fallout. If there is space on this team though we can probably get you guys in"
Otherwise you'll have to rebuild R2 or find another guild/team

I died in the doorway quite a bit. Those suckers lock you in.
been playing it a bunch learning some strategies. I guess hiding actually works when they start hunting and we didn't use the crucifix right
yo Dan let me know if you think you and Kyle would for sure be down for this. we are flushing out the roster and its looking stacked and just want to confirm some people
"do you need to know for 100%? i can say yes, but kyle will be home in an hour"

For retail I dont think population affects anything other than the AH. Retail uses a sharding system where it merges servers together so everything is populated
its some cross realm zone shit where at any point you wont just be with your server
the more important thing is that you are in the same realm battlegroup
only thing it affects is if youre on a different server you cant be in the same guild or some shit
you'll find that on retail population doesnt mean anything because it doesnt feel like an MMO you rarely run into the same people since you can legit paly with anyone on any server
and its all just done through group finder
legit want to do some dungeon? queue up in the group finder invite that person and all teleport to the same shard

"Honest question: Is this supreme court case going to be titled ""Donald Trump vs. the People of the United States?"""
@ONENTCBOI
"yes sir and here is the reasoning in short: leaving initially was the right choice because the Inco team wouldve been a great place to play with friends and put in solid work during raids because their members are held to a higher standard. that falling through sucked ass and the nightsong option was a decent fallback. however, my friends growlie and abian stopped playing after that so it was just me and brewski in my main group. after a week and a half raiding with nightsong we were both annoyed because the team was not the best. tomer had told us they had AQ on farm. they hadnt even killed ouro/cthun. i wasnt able to raid tuesday night but brewski told me it was more of the same and cthun still didnt go down. he decided to leave right then and there and i found out about it yesterday morning so i was like ""well shit"" so i was like fuck it im gonna play with him. he went back to hypnotic so here we are"
"nice people over at nightsong, but they arent putting in the work that brewski and i want to be seeing"
This shit is like a soap opera to read
lmao yea past few weeks have been ridiculous
"Boy I'm on a 14 day quarantine in a dirt pit in the desert, I don't wanna hear about it"
meanwhile im in sweatpants sipping coffee. you right i cant complain
god fucking damn it dude
makes sense
but fuck.
yea i know. not at all how i wanted things to end up lol. if only the inco officers didnt end up bein some bitches
we even had the GM
but a few angry officers dissuaded him
i dont understand why they were so angry.
and yes
NS is not very good
but homies gotta raid
How did Inco fall through
yea for sure. and im sure the team will get better but brewski didnt want to deal with progression again and i agree to an extent
so with Inco they were going to form a 2nd raid team with half of their benched members and half of hypnotic leavers
officers and GM discussed for like a week and determined they didnt want to have to manage a second team.
"even though we already have a roster filled out, raid officers in place, and a raid lead who was eager to start"
its dumb but nothing to do about it now

This raid going to be rough
Wipe counter: 14
Loatheb was NOOOOO joke
we had 3 people call out
all healers
stay tuned for the nightsong world record for most wipes in 1 night
what wing u start on?
spider
easiest wing
yeah
were just bad
faerlina trash was REAL tough
our range cant aoe dps fast enough for anub
so they just keep dying and the scarabs come and spank the melee trying to dps boss
theres scarabs?
"yeah when the crypt guard dies they spawn, and everytime a member of the raid dies another 10 spawn"
it become exponential damage against the raid
oof didnt even notice those
loatheb took us 4 tries ????
"in an interesting turn of events, i didntt have enough gold for my repair bill"

12 wipes?! I don't think I've ever heard you guys get to 12 wipes before.
14
ish
i think i forgot to add one or two
Honest question. What makes you continue to play this game?
"I like trying to learn stuff, I like the people I play with a whole lot. I like trying to play it as best as I can personally"
How do you replicate that feeling to another game? Is it the sense of obligation to the community? Like why people work hard in the Army?
Yall clear them spiders?
Nah faerlina trash gave us the smack down
And to answer ur question jeremy I'm not sure. I think there's a lot of factors that make the community active like that
Its definitely hard to nail down because like why do I feel that way but kyle doesnt?
at least you got anub
faerlina is easy as cake once you get the trash down
how did you guys get them down? we rogues kept getting spanked around and we couldnt get kicks down
we had everyone hide up on the ramp you come down in and LOS pull
me and the other hunter pulled them backto that ramp
and it helped everyone LOS the shadow volleys and kept them clumped up for the most part
then we jumped down and turned the corner on them
so you just put big hots on tanks right as shadowbolt volley then hid and tanks stayed out?
and just nuked the lving shit out of the acolytes
like similar to a firemaw strat?
or more appropriately chromag breath hide?
like techies with the ramp
it helps so only the like 4 tanks are eating the first volley
then everyone jumped in and merked them
its still A TON OF DMG like everyone goes to 1/3 HP but it at least helped the majority of the raid dodge the first volley or two
Also it was some bad tortilla soup
slept for 2 hours ish with food poisoning
This 8 am walkthrough for the audit feels like a fever dream and im losing my mind
"It was a rough night though, we were down 3 main healers due to 1 no show, 1 paged by work a dnt he 3rd was 30 mins late"
we didnt start until like 40 minutes after we should have so we didnt get as far as we wanted
it was refreshing after 13 months of just joke content finally getting an actual challenge
Once works done Dan I can bring up one of the vods and show you how we did the trash

"not even close, my group was garbage"
thats ok. we did a plus 4 sanguine depths and i was the big garbo
healing it was difficult. many wipes. but then we turned around and did another plus 4 no problem
Wait i thought we were raiding this weekend
I have 2 60s papa
Any nice drops?
The 2nd boss was roughhhh
I've heard nathria is fucking harddddd even on normal
2nd boss is a roadblock
Yea feels almost like an end of expansion raid
Need some big juicy heals for it
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/k9p4hg/for_me_castle_nathria_is_the_hardest_expansion/
Good to know it wasn't just us being bad
Good thing we have 1 healer and Dan's fresh 60 gear!
we got this
Ben what do you think is more important a 2nd tank or more heals?
I feel like having 2 tanks that are geared in coms together is > healers with all the mechanics of tank swapping and shit
I can try and recruit folks
Yall played with some guys that kyle said were good dudes?
Also Ryan wants to raid with us but he's not 60 yet and dps so he's out for the week
"I feel healers are super important, there are some insane big damage mechanics"
2 nd boss does that we kept losing people to early on
That's the mythic version so initial damage is different but it ticks for that much
the biggest issue is still tank/heals
"Then he does some other thing that targets people, and if you already have that dot, you're dead"
need 2 tanks and 3 healers if we are doing 10
pugging tanks and healers always super sketchy and hit or miss
Who do we have that CAN tank or heal?
I can tank
on drood or pally
my ilevel on each is 182 and 185 respectively
"Because right now the roster is me, ben, Luke, Kyle, robbie, jg, possibly stephen, possibly the pali i played with last week. I feel like I'm missing people"
@burritodp How was Naxx???
Lol.
Couldn't down the maexma(spelling) but it was ok
Got the FR shoulders
"btw, paladins have to be like the absolute worst healer in mythic +"
I just tried a mythic 3 with a pally healer and I was outhealing the healer on most of the fights. We did not get very far
"Ok so kyle can tank, ben or robbie how confident are yall tanking with your dk's?"
I plan on tnaking or healing
oh shit you got faerlina?
if you cant get maex you can try going to the first 2 bosses in plague they were pretty easy
first 2 of military are pretty easy too as long as your priests are good for raz MCs
Ohh I think they stealth nerfed that abilitity on huntsman. He was doing 6.6k damage per tick last night
Side note ill be doing some edits to this discord this afternoon to streamline our future raiding stuff
"also blood DK is insane, I think their healing rivals paladins"
I outhealed a druid in a mythic dungeon
we need to slam mythics for dan still to get him out of poverty gear
I am the poorest little lad
I need gear on shaman big time too
As long as Dan's gear is at least Heroic in most of the slots he'll be fine
more important to stand outside the mechanics than do big dps
Raid has some big dps checks
"i'm mostly talking about the mythic + stuff, but yeah for raid I think we all need big gear"
Im still rocking several 130~ pieces on shaman :(
i might still raid with you all and i can always respec if need be
id prefer healing over tanking tho
maybe me and kyle rock the DK Paly tank duo
and then Stephen JG + pug heal for the 3
then 5 dps
ill have to heal some mythics or random shit for a bit to get used to retail healing
Paladins are apparently real fucking good for tank healing in raiding so that would be good
DK paladin tank combo probably pretty nuts
prot paly just do so much dmg and healing
and then Blood DK for survival for huge dmg spikes
Got my 184 mythic 2H so I think it's time to get some Blood and UH practice in...
fuck you
I think I've now done like 40 mythics on the DK and still no 2h
if Robbie likes blood though that opens me to go resto druid and we would have our 2 tanks and 3 heals
You got 2 staves on drood at least. I've yet to get a weapon on either character
????
time to farm BGs for pvp weapon?
A conquest 2h takws 4 weeks
cant you upgrade honor to 185 now?
169 I believe.
yo we got a space for growlie?
he would be down to join as dps rogue
also i set up holy. very weird and im not used to it but ill figure it out
my boi brewskipound would probably be down as well
warrior dps
yeah holy paladin super weird in retail
heals more based off of proximity or some shit
cant just sit in the back and press flash of light anymore RIP
yea exactly lol
I assume we got space for more
We're gonna need some ranged
"right now I think the current is 7
Kyle: Prot Paly
Luke: Blood DK (Can also fill resto druid or boomy if we get another tank)
JG: Disc
Stephen: Holy Paly
Ben: Enhc Shaman
Dan: rogue
Robbie: Frost DK"
going to need some ranged dps and another healer
what should i tell my boi growlie
a few of us in here can vouch for his dmg
also im leveling a mage so i might be able to get them raid ready
but then we'd be dropping a heal
If I remember correctly the ideal comp for flex raid is 2/3/9
or maybe it was 2/4/9
is it 15 man?
nah its flex raid in retail can go in with like 10-25 or something
and scales based on numbers
I think ideal numbers for a small group were 2/2/6 or 2/3/9
with 2 heals and 2 tanks might want to aim for 2/2/6
Whats growlie playing?
rogue
https://www.wowhead.com/news=317979/shadowlands-season-1-mythic-item-level-loot-table-max-end-of-dungeon-reward-redu
should aim for +5/6 this week
If we can push harder better but I think baseline on all chars should try and get  5/6
"im also rogue, is there a good reason to not have 2?"
Yeah one might be too loud and reveal the others position
I fear you are underestimating my sneakiness sir

feral is slapping people in PvP
Yeah i was playing with it a ton
I can't believe they are nerfing boomkin but not fera
not sure how it didnt get nerfed
probably because only 5 people per server play feral druid
feral is realyyyy strong right now. I was doing like 30-40k in a burst opener
it's tough to play well
Hahahah
Those salty rogue comments crying because they cant 1shot people with no skill now
Can't trade cds when you're dead from an opener in 2s
Its hilarious how salty the rogues are because they got nerfed
Theyre upset they cant get free glad anymore
Complaining about dying the easiest while at the same time 1shoting every other class
why they bringing prot pallys into this
I chose a survivable spec
to survive
Also saying they're only good at cc/stuns in pvp like its a bad thing lol
Lol thats hilarious
the real spec that needs to be nerfed is guardian drood
it's OP
BEING ABLE TO STUNLOCK AND CC FOR 20 SECONDS IS BORING AND NOT GOOD
That's boring gameplay but being able to kill people in 2s is fun for everyone!
The weekly dungeon quest gives a piece of HEROIC castle loot

Don't open vault until you do 4 mythics for quest!
Don't want heroic nath item to be same as what you picked from vault
ooooo true
smart
yeha go do 4 myhtics for loot so you dont get 2 pairs of pants
they probably nerfed torgast because they looked at the logs from kyle and my run last night

Wow gold. Exclusively.
What's the conversion currently?
Sent direct to dem Arby's boys g bank
safer investment than the dollar
"currently the conversion is about 130,000 gold to $15"
Churches expect 10% of your income at least right?
Depends on your specific religion
that's what tithe means
10%
Oh. TIL
I didn't know that either

Yeet
What does that mean??^^
"GG @jmats, you just advanced to level 2!"
Fuck you.
It means I am papa personals chosen
"In my church growing up they taught that you should budget using 80-10-10 financial plan. 80% of your income goes to rent, food, utilities and other necessities; 10% goes to the church as your tithe; and 10% goes to a savings or investment account for retirement"
"GG @Deathtrap69420, you just advanced to level 4!"
Honestly thats a better financial plan than I got
that being said - most religion is a huge grift
Mainly Christianity.
What a fantastic scam
Idk man I believe in god
I agree the majority of followers are blind pawns
Since fucking when?
Made to make money for the church
the whole churches don't have to pay taxes was a fantastic move by the religious in this country
Agreed kyle

@jmats did you figure out what game were getting
I'd like to do a Day-Z esque week.
Like a team survival game
Like rust?
Day-z is still fucked up i think
"Like Rust. 
The Forest looks good"
Dying Light would be a lot of fun. You already have that.
What about raft?
Also i wish more than anything subnautica was multiplayer
that would be the one
The second Subnautica is isn't it?
i think theres only 1 out
hop in chat
I enjoy survival games. You already know we are all hopping on that new world train when it's out
Survival esque mmo with souls like combat
yeeeee
"What other ones are there? I know there's rust, the forrest, I think ark survival was one too but it's older at this point, but has dinosaurs"
im bout ashes of creation though
I have rust
"We will see about ashes, something about it seems super off for me still. Need them to really polish off the combat in that game"
I get it's like pre alpha and far away but that combat demo the revealed before xmas didn't really sell me on it
I didnt see that. What was the issue?
I was pretty sold on the early test of new world we played though. Once they finish out some of the issues with that game it's going to be tighttt
Was also fucking beautiful
https://youtu.be/V_hsJPB8y7k
"They really just need to flesh out the combat a bit more. More skills, more weapons"
"Watch for yourself, something just seems off for me"
Like seems like old fucking everquest combat slow and clunky with new polished graphics
i was talking about new world
They already added a bunch of weapons and changed the combat
That preview event was from a build from like last year
"They already have a spear, great axe and like 4 other weapons I saw"
I just wana hit them with the hammer
And weapons don't share CDs you can swap between them and weapon dance to weave abilities
Shoot me now

"H-2 Family,
Its with a heavy heart that I am letting you know that our friend Kyle Reeves, class of 16, passed away this past Thursday. This is all very sudden and details are still forthcoming. Those of you that knew Kyle know that he was known for his incredible kindness, his sense of humor, and his general friendly demeanor. He was an incredible friend to all who knew him and will be sorely missed. I count myself among the lucky ones who could know Kyle, and IÉ??m sure many of you feel the same. I will be sure to post updates about a memorial service. Please keep his family in your prayers over the coming days. Feel free to share some of the most memorable moments with him so that I can pass it along to his family. If you have any questions or just need someone to talk to, feel free to reach out to me on facebook or at my cell xxx xxx xxxx."
How does this look?
Worked on it a bit:
"H-2 Family,
It is with a heavy heart that I share the news that our friend Kyle Reeves, Class of 2016, passed away this past Thursday. Kyle was an incredibly kind person, had a keen and cutting sense of humor, and was a steadfast friend to all who knew him. I count myself among the lucky ones who could know Kyle; he was a dear companion and confidante, able to bring light and happiness into my life in even the darkest of times. I will forever treasure the moments I was able to share with him and cannot express how much IÉ??ll miss him.
Please keep his family in your prayers over the coming days. If you could, share some of your most vivid memories with and of him so I can pass them along to his family. I will be sure to post updates about a memorial service. If you have any questions, or just need someone to talk to as we all piece our feelings together, feel free to reach out to me on facebook or at my cell, xxx-xxx-xxxx."
"Jeremy told me yesterday, I haven't heard from him since last night, I hope he's doing alright. I got his message while I was getting my COVID vaccine yesterday morning. I can't believe it. I have no words. I didn't really do all that well a job of keeping it together.

Kyle was such an amazing dude. He was a great son, great brother, great friend, and outstanding Officer. He was loved deeply by those around him, their sheer multitude a testament to his character. I have so much more I could say to celebrate his life

I poured one last night in silent vigil for Kyle last night. Be thou at peace brother."

Dark souls survival??
Thats my kink
People are saying co-op survival game like terraria or ark/rust in a viking setting with the difficulty of dark souls where you can just die from anything
That's all of our kinks combined.

Luke wouldn't know because he's scared to play
I actually think Bloodborne is the best souls game.
Bloodborne is way too difficult of a game.
I want to go back and beat the DLC since Ive only done base game but its just way too difficult to learn to play again. Reflexes too slow
Music is cool though
"I dunno if it's the same with Bloodborne but my reflexes were, not""too fast"", but that i was too stressed and button mashed way too quickly. I couldn't beat the final boss for like ages. I had three beers and beat him in the first try. I think that's how confident FromSoftware players are so good. They know it's not about how quick you can press the most buttons, but when to press the correct buttons that matter."
Sounds games are rhythm game. Once I made that realization it made it much easier. If you stop treating it like an action game and more like guitar hero you're g2g
"^yes, this."

"Def a good case - it's bigger than you technically need because it's a mid tower (""ATX form factor"") and I think we've got you set up with a micro ATX board right now (one size smaller), but your setup would absolutely still fit in it and it would give you more room to work with. I like having a smaller computer so I've got a micro ATX case (Fractal Design Meshify C Mini, which I really like). Corsair, NZXT, and Fractal Design all make pretty good cases though, so you really can't go wrong. I'd also check out the dimensions of the case and check it against wherever you want to put it - mid towers can actually get pretty big, bigger than computers from Dell/HP/etc"

"For those of you watching anxiously at home, I decided to take a nap to prep for my paper. And woke up at 0500. So that was neat."
Well did you feel prepared?
"Oh yeah. Well rested, totally prepared. Definitely not just slamming my hands on the keyboard until I reach the page count"
It didnt help that once I started looking at my teachers revisions from my last submission that the 8 pages I had written quickly turned into 5.
Ooooft. That's rough. What time is it due?
Noon but I only have an hour or so till I cant work on it anymore
I got it though
3 years of writing papers at the very last minute is my specialty
Yeah think about how long it would have taken if you started it last night. Now it's only taking a few hours.
Much more efficient!

"Manager Claudette moved with the quickness of a jungle cat as she lept into her burgundy Turcel to give chase. (I dunno)

In a frenzied moment of knowing candor, I looked toward Derrell and Tino and uttered a stirring call to action. Dem Arby'z Boys, WHEELS UP  !~!

SKENT SKERNT

we were nearing the rivers edge when i looked toward D and T when I wondered, how much more aphibian than man would we need to be to properly 
trounce this malfactor in an aquatic altercation that will no doubt take every ounce of me, and perhaps take more ounces than D and T even have 
in their pints (I dont know) but with one last look of a warrior's accord we vaulted. vaulted higher than Meatloaf's motorcycle bursting 
through the devilish graveyard's stony sod. AND just like the 'Loaf we soared. AND just like the 'Loaf we sang:

Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes

(ONE, TWO, THREE)

When the night is over, like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone, gone, gone"
"And for all the cirminals and hold uppers out there fixin' to mess with Claudette and Dem Armby'z Boyz, let this be a lesson to you all

ha-ha-ha HA

For we are more bonded than the Gorilla Glue betwixt the hull and wings of a Focke-Wulf Tribflugel model 1/48th scale.

We are more dedicated to the servitude and defense of out meaty HQ than Cheetara and Lion-O defending Thundercat's Lair

And I am Snarf Ready, ho. 

For when the aggressors arise and try to inflict evil against the kingdom of beef and ched

So too will a band of mighty heroes arise. Heroes hell bent on protecting the curly fries and jalapeno bites of honor, Paladins of Pork, 
dead set on defending the buttermilk chicken and buffalo sliders of this cheesy citadel.

FOR WE, D A B, will fight against the Mumm-Ras and Muggers of the world , bound not by fear, but brotherly love 

And in the timeless words of Fredo Starr, Sonny Seeza, Big DS and Sticky Fingaz, we will proclaim!

SLAM, duh duh duh --- duh duh duh --- we dem Arbyz Boyz

SLAM, duh duh duh --- duh duh duh --- we dem Arbyz Boyz"

Scenes from gunnery
That looks thrilling
"Oh man, where do I sign up for that party?"
"GG @Dingus, you just advanced to level 8!"
From Dan's wedding to that scene. Robby having himself a week for sure
"But that's what the clearing pit is for, right??"
"Hey that's what I argued to range safety, got them re-certified to shoot this morning haha"
One of our brad crews forgot to lock their barrel in and launched it down the range once.  That was entertaining
Nice though.  No steak and eggs for them

how many months pregnant was this Dan?
2nd trimester
What day are we starting DnD?
"What days of the week work best for everyone to use as the ""default"" night? Friday? Saturday? 
I still have some work to do on it (and my parents are visiting today through Tuesday...) but I'm leaning towards running some mini sessions with pairs of players as lead-ins to the campaign starting late next week or weekend, followed by a full launch with all players either the weekend of 10 or 17 Apr"
Who all is planning on regularly playing even?
I would like to play but I don't think I can commit to every week when I'm starting training again
Not even on weekends?
Don't be like that carm.
Work is dumb anyways
"I'm aware of Dan/Carm/Curtis/Stephen/JG/Jeremy - I've built it to be more flexible for transient players, so could have a larger pool of people with characters, but probably can't run for more than 6ish in a given session"
I will also be somewhat erratic as I go to Korea in late May and figure out what my schedule looks like there
"GG @Humer, you just advanced to level 7!"
They told me I will get a random day as my weekend but I don't know what day that is yet
Sounding like my unit over there
For now until May I can do weekends (except apr 10)

anyone have good keyboard recommendations? I spilled a glass of water on mine last night and its fucked up
gotta get a new one
mechanical or membrane?
Doesn't matter to me. I had a membrane
I don't like how loud mechanical are. Are there silent ones you don't have to hear clacking all day long
depends on the kind of switches you have
I believe I have browns which aren't super clicky
and you get used to it to be honest.  Feels way better to type on a mechanical keyboard too.

We got a 3rd tough box
Turning in rentals
Goddamit Dan and Curtis get it together
It's been a hell of a day
I need you to get it together and make it on those flights with the PCs
Do you both have precheck?
Yeah
Oh then 40 mins is plenty of time
you good
But now they can't figure out my friggin car

If you're going for quantity why not just sack up and drink malt liquor

Yes
"Bridget Jones, xxx, high school music. Heard of all of those"
They are all knock offs. High School Musical remix

That's the second one right?
This is why I formulated the original question. Has anyone SEEN any of these movies?
....no
"I think you should invest in ""best of web video"""

I'm personally interested in what 'New Pound Glory' is.
"GG @jmats, you just advanced to level 11!"
Are you sure those arent cheep pornos?
New pound glory smells like one
I've seen Bridget Jones's Diary and  Failure to Launch.

"Need computer help. Set everything bag up now I'm getting a cpu fan error. Fans still spin, but immediately on boot up the sensors are reading 99?¯c. Coolant temp for radiator is same as it usually is around 65?¯c. Not sure if sensors aren't working or if I'm melting the cpu"
it doesn't make sense that your CPU would be at 99 celsius immediately on booting up
"You've got liquid cooling on the CPU right? From an all in one system? Most mobos will automatically thermal throttle the CPU and then shut it down if it gets too hot, so very unlikely that you'll melt it (and it wouldn't get up to 99C that fast if you're just in the boot/post screens)"
@burritodp  you should probably just buy a whole new rig and sell me your old one at a wildly marked down price
Or sell it to me!
ILL SELL YOU MINE @mccmela . AND I WILL SELL IT FOR CHEAP
That's like buying a level boost in WoW - you need to have the realllll experience the first time through
Have you seen Carmela computer...?
I don't know what a level boost is but I'll buy it. No shame
@burritodp my coolant temps rarely go above 35C sounds like something is up

I bought a car.
But they were having a buy one get one free so I bought two

Anyone not doing anything right now that can hop on to discord and help me manage some server settings. Need to see if the changes im making are working
@Admin/Pic Historian @deleted-role @Halo Hobbledehoys
Nice work v clean
Still need help?
I may later. I'll write up the changes in a bit so everyone knows how to add people and other new stuff
"GG @burritodp, you just advanced to level 12!"
This one is a classic
@everyone Anyone want to Zone in  40 minutes??
@everyone
"sounds good, so like 845 cst?"
"So the changes I made to the discord are as follows; 
1.) I updated all the permissions, so anyone who gets added to the discord will recieve the PUG tag. With the PUG tag they will only be able to access Destiny Chat, the raid chat voice channel, and they can see the welcome channel. I did this so that the randoms that join the server for destiny or wow or whatever cant access all of our stuff, or just jump into calls with people we actually know. People joining the server will receive a DM on discord telling them to shoot me a message for additional permissions.
2.) If its someone who we know and you want them to join one of the other voice channels you can all now drag them into a different voice channel (have them join the raid chat and then you can just drag them anywhere you want. This will allow people we know who join to be in any channel until I can give them the correct permissions. 
3.) You can all now make emojis (I know you asked for it Carm) 
4.) Im not great at discord, so if you guys see any issues (cant access channels, anything funky happening) just let me know and Ill try to fix it. 

What im trying to avoid is having this discord be full of randoms that we dont know. Make sure you smash that like button and absolutely massacre that subscribe button."

@Humes what's going on in hypno
"Long story short - we talked about TBC. Deezy is focusing on Horde so is stepping down as guild lead. Most Hypno people are still maining Alliance but a good amount will have Horde alts on Benediction. Unknown who new guild lead will be (probably Dan, Verb, or another one of the officers). Talked a bit about raid teams as well, but nothing is really set in stone for that as a lot of people don't know what they'll play."
This was after wiping on KT a shit ton of times and failing to kill. So no atiesh for vex and no loot for anyone else. Big rip
lol your classic guild has been like a soap opera
so much fun and drama listening to yours and dan's classic experience
gotta love it
I just wish we had Naxx on farm already. We're so inconsistent
have you at least downed KT?
yea we have like 4-5 times now

"no, but i know that is your cup of tea so I made sure you in particular could access the young lad chat"

"A guy joined the discord yesterday who was rather young. In order to prevent our friends having to deal with randos in every chat, I have set it up so that people new to the discord can only access destiny chat and raid chat."

Question. Is there another housing bubble right now. Kinda feels like it
Yes. It's an affordability crisis too
What does the pop look like and whens it happening
"Possibly when the fed raises interest rates again. The last one was because too many people were getting in houses they couldn't afford because the white picket fence is the ""American dream"""
"Then when everyone found out that people kept defaulting on mortgages... Boom, the house of cards fell pretty quickly"
"I think this time, people are getting into homes because they think it will make them money"
The first hint that it might not... And poof. I know my grandfather bought a house for $300k put $100k in upgrades and it just sold for $260k. Real estate is not a guarantee
I think traditional investment vehicles are usually better long term.
"It's insanity though, seeing homes appreciate at a rate of 10-20% per year. It's all very ""boomy."" Like the people with money are moving to this spot, house prices go up. When they leave, then what?"
"So many people swear by real estate as a money-making business for their passive income. @jmats had a good run with it, but I'm sure he's glad he doesn't have to deal with it anymore. A lot of work."

Have any of yall watched West World?
I watched the first season
Same. Lost interest halfway through season 2

:sharkboy:
"Re:Westworld. Basically a committee of HBO execs got together and were like: we're going to make the edgiest show ever. The problem is that when everything is supposed to be full of shock value, nothing has shock value. Pretty empty show with some cool visual effects, but all it accomplishes is pleasing the /r/iam14andthisisdeep crowd. Got boring pretty quickly."
Watch Firefly instead

I HAD A 3080 IN MY CART ON BEST BUY
It wouldn't go through cause my store location was Kentucky
Rip
It's not worth the struggle man
Itll never happen
How much are these thingies
they have no value
infinite dollars
made of unobtainium
Depends on demand. Scalpers own most of the free float right now
"RTX 3080s retail for $800-900 but yeah, getting scalped for 2-3x that"
MSRP is $699 for the 3080. $1499 for the 3090.
"I had a neurotic week, found some valuable OSINT and purchased mine for $770"
for a Superclocked version of the 3080
Operating System Intelligence?
but that was a lifetime ago
in October
OSINT: Open Source Intel
"aka, ZOTAC announced on twitter when it was going to drop their brand new 3080 AMP Holos"
reddit = OSINT lol
@jmats you had it in your cart during today's drop at 4:30pm EST?
Yep
"I guess it was a decent drop today, everything was on sale"
Do they always drop at the same time?
it seems like the trend is that they drop around 2-5pm est
"For anyone paying attention to the Alec zeck chronicles,  he's now a presenter/teacher at the academy of divine knowledge"

Idk bro. It's all fucking wacko
he got out of the Army for the lucrative career of spreading theocratic disinformation?
To be fair... It's a very lucrative career...
"if you have fucked morals, it'd be so easy to be a right-wing talking head"
just look at the guy who is Q
I'm thinking back to where MMI where he asked for a loan from his father for around $10k to buy all the new Jordans in the one store in Northern Alabama and scalp them. He's not dumb. He's clever when it comes to money. This may very well be a money making scheme
How the heck did he get out of the army already?

Don't sweat it @burritodp. Mortgage Backed Securities are as strong as ever. There is no way the Fed is going to increase the borrow rate soon due to inflation and cause most of APR mortgages to default. You'll be fiiiiiine.

do the 'Mary and Joseph' bit. Say she is expecting and you are looking to be long term renters.
When I was a homeowner that would have got me interested in an applicant over other ones.
Sidenote: Is homeowner defined as when you don't have any mortgage payments left? if so I was 27 years away from being a home owner.
Missed it by that much
What percentage of the population you think actually owns a home?
5-10% is my guess?
Boomers
Exclusively
Also dude we barely even speak to the landlords anymore
For the most part they don't pick up the phone or answer emails
It's all self guided tours and online applications
FUN FACT: Mark Zuckerburg owns 2% of the wealth of all Millennials.
The oldest Millennials are 41....
interesting well hopefully you get that one
Rip generational wealth

the REAL reason no one talks to their landlords anymore is because most landlords own a significant number of properties and can't personally manage all of them.
Wtf is the silent generation

Wait what
Oh jesus.... So now you're just stuck in europe still until you can get an army flight who knows when
basically
Join the army they said
Fuck dude that's awful
So what do you do? You no longer in command and now just stuck in europe
"Yeah.  I do nothing, really.  I'm sure they'll trump up some dumb shit for me to work on"
I'm editing a letter of recommendation for one of my LTs currently
You said shit is booked through may?
"I called the Brigade mobility warrant officer who books the flights, because our Battalion admin officer (S1) didn't know what to tell me.  He then went and complained to the Brigade S1, who then yelled at the Battalion S1 for bothering the Brigade mobility warrant officer"
"Allegedly they're all booked up, yes.  But the mobility warrant is the only one who can access the system to book flights, and so I sent him a copy of my orders to see what he can do"
Somebody about to lose their flight
"I don't appreciate my Battalion Commander being aware of the situation and basically being like ""yeah that sucks, good luck"""
which is exactly what he did earlier this morning
But I guess that's the way we treat officers around here!  No wonder our retention rates are trash

Brad's mom
@burritodp have you played Control? I was watching my roommate play it and it's got some X-Files vibes. Might be something you and Catherine would like. Free on epic and really positive reviews
No i havent even heard of it.
premise?
"The game revolves around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a secret U.S. government agency tasked with containing and studying phenomena that violate the laws of reality. As Jesse Faden (Courtney Hope), the Bureau's new Director, the player explores the Oldest House É?? the FBC's paranormal headquarters É?? and utilize powerful abilities in order to defeat a deadly enemy known as the Hiss, which has invaded and corrupted reality. The player gains abilities by finding Objects of Power, mundane objects like a rotary phone or a floppy disc imbued with energies from another dimension, that have been at the center of major paranormal events and since recovered by the FBC."
hmm
could be good...

Have yall looked at r hardware swap?
I've bought computer components off of there before
I'm thinking about trying to get a 3090 on it
I just don't want to get burned
The 30 series cards I've seen on there tend to be near MSRP (they kinda nuke scalpers) but generally tend to be local pickup or else they'll have like 50 DMs in 60 seconds for a single card
So it's tough
But I had no issues with shipping for the stuff I did buy
I figure if I just keep on it I may be able to snag one. It seems to be the best chance
I've been on fb market and all the prices are 3k
@Humer me explaining to king rupe how he took a photo with my friend in a far away land many moons ago
I'm talking to a guy about a gigabyte 3090 used but at msrp
Or a brand new evga 3090 ultra but that's 400 over msrp
Should run that Cat6 cable to the room first tho
I bought the 100 ft cable
I was going to put up all the cable hiders today but its like 100?¯ out and portable ac is struggling

My dude. Its way too hot.
I'm having to spray water and stand in front of the fan
"Well, did you pray?"
Also do yall think 2400 shipped is a good price for a evga 3090 ftw 3 is a good price
I dunno bud. That's like a years worth of diapers.
I'm not sure why that's relevant
It's also like 4.8k bananas
Or 3 gallons of gas
Half of the price of an ambulance trip.
3 months of insulin.
6 ujm motorcycles
How much Jeff Bezos makes every 0.0043 seconds
Knowing all that. Wait longer or buy. I think tax is usually around 150 or 200 on new gpus. So all in all retail is like 2200
you can build an entire new PC for 2400
Not with a 3090
you guys heard of GTFO? on sale on steam and it seems like it would be a fun 4 player shooter

at least for me
I love phasmophibia
It's so fucking fun

It's only fun if the people you play with buy into it

"@burritodp if we get another server boost, then there are a lot of perks like 128kbps streaming audio"
and 1080p60 streaming for all
"Nah, it has three. we should have that now"
"alright, server is at level 2 now"
Yall are big generous
"I mean two boosts, level one"
128kbps should be fresh audio quality 4 my new ASMR content
level 2 is 15 boosts. that's like $200 a year for higher upload size.
"yeah, level 2 is wild"
"level 3, 384kbps audio ????"
@burritodp Up the bitrate on Gateway to the Boy's Soul please
"Do you remember Mumble and Teamspeak? 18-32kbps audio, so crazy"
streaming quality boost is for webcam
@jmats from Regina
How I do that
Gateway is now at 128

Can you guys think of anything worth backing up before I reformat my rig
You can back up drivers with Driver Max. Back up saved games for anything that doesn't store in the cloud (inside My Docs or inside the game folder itself). Backup WoW screenshots and Interface folders to preserve add-ons and UI setup.
smort
If you have a big external HDD you can make backups of Steam games to avoid reinstalling them if your internet is slow
I think the only stuff not cloud saved is my dark souls stuff for the most part on steam
but ima just back it up to a external
that plus ui stuff for wow

and let it rip
Yeah any random stuff that you have in Documents/Photos/etc

Anyone know what DraftKings actually is? I just watched a guy put $500 real on one hand of Blackjack from his phone. It has a live stream of a real person dealing cards and he just says when he wants to hit or not. How is this legal?
"Does DraftKings do actual casino games? I thought they only did fantasy/sports stuff, which is apparently considered a game of skill in the US so not covered by gambling laws. Most of the websites that Twitch streamers etc go to for blackjack/poker (where they're watching a cam of a live dealer) are based internationally in countries with more favorable gambling laws."
"Draft Kings took that underground bookie market into the mainstream to the detriment of society. Be a man, gamble for real, buy DOGE and GME"

Almost. It gives you 30 days after deactivating before it deletes. But I just reset the timer this weekend to grab a video.
no more dank snaps? ????

@all, would you guys want to come to my cabin Veterans Day Weekend? It can sleep a ton, so everyone is welcome"
Yes.
React with carm's face for yes
That cabin looks freaking sweet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8x3ppanVwo
"Entire cabin hosted by Susanna
4.5/5 Stars.

""Great location and beautiful surrounding area. This is a fantastic spot to just get away with the family. Susanna was pleasant and had that Southern charm and hospitality you hear so much about. The only reason this cabin didn't get a 5/5 for me was because at one point Susanna became convinced that one of my friends staying at the cabin was her son. We didn't quite know how to handle the situation and it did make us a bit uncomfortable until she calmed down.""

THAT sounds like a great scary story

My parents are going to be in town otherwise I would be super down to thrash y'all in Catan.
Have you guys seen For All Mankind?

New puppy?
"I've heard good things about it. Watch party??
It's my childhood doggo!!"
Watch party
"As a casual enjoyer of the FUD circus that is network news, I can't help but notice that the campaign against service members as being ""woke"" is intensifying. Can't go on any social media and not see it littered with comments by these FUD acolytes about how the military is so ""woke"" or ""sure they can march, but are they woke"" or at worst: something to the effect of ""the military can't win wars because it is woke.""

Thoughts on this FUD? I'm fairly certain the voices and amplifying voices making these statements wouldn't know the first thing about military service, nor would they serve, but I'll leave room for uncertainty there."
"Our wokeness's isn't what is going to kill us in a Lsco fight. It's going to be years of boot licking and our in ability to prioritize. The onset of email and computers, coupled with a deep desire from senior leaders to look good, has cause our standing army to sacrifice effective training for half asked execution iot desperately try to keep up with the endless list of top priority tasks"
Yeah I think IÉ??m with Dan on this one
"Agreed, but I can't help but think those ""woke"" FUD sources can't just be originating in the US. How much is the Kremlin paying Tucker Carlson to deride the American government?"
"The military has constantly said yes to everything: can we play world cop? ""yes"" can we nation build? ""yes"" can we act as a cookie cutter solution to any major problem? ""Yes"""
Thankfully I think senior leaders are slowly starting to realize weÉ??ve asked way too much of company/field grade leadership within the last ten years and are trying to reel the behemoth back in to more sensible metrics.  WeÉ??ll never get away from being data driven but we have to get senior leaders comfortable with being able to operate with less fresh data
"That culmination of enduring ""yes""s and not enough people saying no or asking why has stretched out the military greatly. Honestly, I'm glad we are out of Afghanistan, there are so many other important things going on, we've got to get refocused."
"I think the Army has been thrust into this cycle of constantly wanting to do more since the advent of nuclear weapons removed it from a position of national security guarantor. This has perpetuated and continued to cause issues. A solid decade of focus would do us well. I honestly think that a lot of the leaders in charge share a vision of wanting to focus on the ""big rocks"" again."
"** Question of the Day**
So, for a while, one of the two 300TD's has been giving me an issue. 

The problem: After sitting overnight, the battery is _sometimes_ dead or near dead the next time I try to start it. What could it be?

First Hypothesis: Bad battery (won't hold charge). 
Experiment: Tested battery and it's healthy. Not Battery.

Second Hypothesis: Leaving the key in the ignition causes a battery drain on this car (even though the identical one does not. Maybe an aftermarket mod?) 
Experiment: Removing the key does stop the battery draining overnight. However, causes another symptom.

New symptom: Whether i leave the key in the ignition or not, the rear-passenger side door has locked itself when the car is left for some? period of time. (Keep in mind, the locks are vacuum-line powered, not electric, in the 83 model.)

This has had me stumped for a while but finally figured it out. Anyone want to take a guess at what is causing this?"
"Answer: Mike and the Dirty Boys are using your 300TD for an F Shack. 

When you leave your keys in the ignition, Mike and his minions run the car's AC and other amenities (without fully turning the car on) IOT stay comfortable while performing their sexual conquests in your vintage vehicle. This drains the battery. Whenever you remove the key in your little experiment, the horny homeless are forced to get even hotter, and even sweatier than normal while performing the deed. Either to get back at you for removing their comfort, or to prevent even MORE dirty boys joining the party (making the car even hotter), they lock the rear passenger door."
Solved
"@jbarnes (toyotathon) Is correct. Today, I found a rolled up dog bed (presumably being used as a pillow) nearest to the door that was always locking itself. Instead of AC, Dirty Mike had been turning on heat, but not starting it, in an attempt to heat up the car. Unfortunately providing no heat and also draining the battery."
"LMAO 
That is amazing"
next step is to install a security camera to see what this dude looks like lol
I left a note saying you have to run the engine to get the heat to work.
You should leave some sunscreen too.
And a water bottle!

"**Question of the Day**

Where are the best seats in a movie theater? Why?"
"Reference Stephen's picture for optimal height off the ground. I prefer the left and right sides because generally there are less people near you, and if its just you, or you and a few friends, people probably won't sit near you. Screens are so big these days, I don't think it makes a huge difference in viewing experience if you aren't smack in the middle."
The best seats are the ones away from randos and also right next to my homies
I nominate these seats as the best seats in a movie theater
"Why: because they look super comfy AND, if you're lucky, you might find a sticky surprise from the last customer"

@Humes is tarkov good? I own it but never played really
im actually enjoying it right now but you have to go into it with the expectation that you will die very easily and lose a lot of shit
for beginners ive found that its best to just do scav runs on CD so that if you die you arent really losing anything
then run your PMC with the guns and gear you get from you successful scav runs
Can you play with friends?

I'll re-download it
id love to play with more people and im quite early into it so id play with ya

Don't worry @burritodp you and I share the same hatred for work now.
What had happened
"When my boss was gone, someone put me on the FUOPS team to temporarily help while all this craziness happens in the world. The thing is, I have been given barely anything to do and it was done without my bosses consenting"
So I'm working for a civilian curmudgeon who isn't even my rater and now I too have no weekends.
"I understand that, but to be in to just sit around with no guidance, no defined workload or schedule? And I haven't done a smack of work for this guy for 6 hours"
"If I made good on my threats to myself to be done at 8, I would just peace"
"It's not the hours. It's the understanding of the pure futility of my time being taken away. It's the ever present realization that my time has no value, regardless of impact, experience, education, etc. And the it's the fact that my time can be seized for such futility rapidly and with impunity."

Just get a Steelcase Office Chair
But the lumbar. And the fps gain
Steelcase is what I have. It has amazing lumbar
Buy does it make you a certified e girl and come with a pair of cat ears?

Herman Miller is amazint
It's still 1.5k....
"I mean, preferably you never have to buy another chair"
Good furniture is expensive
My Kimbal gaming chair broke after 3 years
"I have the Steelcase Leap, it's so nice to sit in. Probably contributes to my revenge procrastination because it's comfy to just sit in it late at night"
My office chair at work is unusable in comparison. I usually just stand because of it
"@burritodp you are big boi, treat yo self"
Herman Miller chair has a 12 year warranty too
That's a $120/yr investment in your comfort for 12 years
There's no way I'm getting a herman miller
Ye
I could have bought 2x tanjas for that price
Name a better return on investment.
You can also buy a nice office chair used
"By used, I mean refurbished for resale. New fabric, etc"
"i also considered the leap, embody, and aeron dan but yea price is what put me off"
even resold ones or used ones were still expensive or hard to find
i figure when im rich in a couple years ill get an embody but i wont worry about that now

@jmats what's your mom's address
Need to send a thank you. I know it's big bone rd union ky. I just don't know the house number
"Weird, i travel down big bone road to visit brads mom all the time. Neighbors maybe?"

Guys there is a new bob ross documentary on Netflix. We should have watched that!
"I don't think ima watch it, I don't want my mental view of Bob Ross tarnished"
"GG @burritodp, you just advanced to level 18!"
I think itÉ??s negative about the producers of the show rather than him

Would you guys be down to start a PMC after weÉ??re all out of the military
DanWaterÉ?õ
I don't know why I keep using Dan for my company ideas. I guess I just think he'd be the best CEO
"I like it. And if we flop, we always pivot to DanÉ??s Water where we just sell DanÉ??s used bath water"
Agreed.
"Oh man, @BromoYeti I think you may need to re-examine your judge of character"
"You're either way off, or just recognize I would probably be the best fall guy"
We need your name attached @burritodp so your dad can give us our seed money
Smart
Something something about Dan's father's seed being more useful this time around.
Zing. The joke is that I'm worthless. Thank you Jeremy! Great joke! I love joshin around with my pals.

Yep
I'll download it now
Little busy at the moment @dan
@burritodp I should be back in a few hours. You're going to need to complete a longish tutorial anyway to play coop
Plus it'll be night and spooky

Am I drowning? Am I the hand and Carmela is the ocean? I'm confused but still excited to be a part of the high five.
In between the third and fourth frame I pull you out and prevent you from drowning
Fourth frame is a shot from a different part of the ocean. ThatÉ??s where Carm is. With no high five in sight
Ah. Post modern deconstructed meme template. Great work @jbarnes (toyotathon)
High five
Sidenote: thanks @burritodp and @SJ_Sidekick . Dying Light is infinitely less spooby when you're not playing by yourself.
Resubmitting as potential adventure game
For the DCPA
IÉ??ll cave it and get it when I get back today. WhatÉ??s the max number of players you can play with
4 in a team but you can drop in and out of the storyline of whoever's leading.
I'm still in favor of having @Humer be a squad leader in Squad and we all just role play as lower enlisted in his squad
If we think we need more than 4 player game.
I will be chief Dying Light backseat driver but will not be playing. Toooooo spoooby
I have dying light so if you ever need an extra player just let me know
Rude
I enjoyed it
It was very spooky at night

I vote for Oscar October! Every film must have done named Oscar who worked on it!
Also @Humer can this be our next campaign
Hmm. Any other pitches beside a movie every night?
Halloween themed dnd. See above nandor meme
Or we all play a game like dying light?
Dying light! I don't know if we even have a foursome yet

In honor of the arrival of the most joyous season of Autumn and the acclaimed ~ *Pumpkin Spiced Latte* ~ I propose - nay, demand - that we all complete a 8 week lifting program so that we are shredded by the time we get to J.G's family's lake-house, wherein, once we assemble we will complete the DPCA triathlon. What type of triathlon, you ask? Well, that remains to be seen. Regardless of your attendance on Veteran's Day Weekend, everyone will complete this 8 week program. I will take no questions and will not revise my demand."
Carm sneakily changing it from an 8 week program to a 12 week program in the same paragraph
I love that 'Doctor Spaghetti Arms' is criticizing the length of the workout program.
"@Humer, Carm didnÉ??t specify the program. She did however mention pumpkin spiced lattes and a vague collection of events. For all we know the events could be drinking related. I say the only lifting we do Robby is a glass to our lips"
The lifting program will be posted shortly.
"Set 1: 3 reps of tequila (1.5 oz) 
Set 2: 3 reps of Long Island ice tea 
Set 3: 12 hours of Shavasana"

"Hot take: no more mandates, no nothing. No vaccine requirements."
However if you choose not to get the vaccine you lose the right to be seen by Healthcare professionals for all things covid related
You got to deal with it over the counter
"And if you die, you die."
Same for if you're fat. Your lose the right to get treated for any diseases related to being overweight
I'm on board
or if you eat sugar. You lose the right to be seen for diabetes
or if you get old. Lose the right to be seen for heart disease or cancer.
refuse medical care to people based on their life choices Dan
fucking Nazi
"The difference @jmats is that those choices don't regularly inundate the medical field and make it difficult/impossible to treat other non choice related sicknesses. The vaccine is 1) free 2) regularly available. The choice to not get it impact a far wider range of people other than just yourself. If I get cancer, you don't get cancer by proxy."
We already have laws in place to dissuade poor choices
It's the legal system in a nutshell.
"You choose to get blackout drunk and drive, that's fine, you made a choice but there are consequences to said choice"

@here Halo infinite multiplayer coming out early today for the 20th anniversary. Full release still coming out in December
https://tenor.com/view/fat-guy-dancing-moves-gif-14156580
https://c.tenor.com/nFkgwnJuMr0AAAAM/omg-tim.gif
its on steam now
already started to download so hopefully after work its done and I can dive into it
Wonder if its any good or just another just alright 343 halo game
or if its going to have fuck tons of issues with an early release
stay tuned
im just hoping it puts vanguard and battlefield to shame so they get their shit together
"we beta tested it, it is good"
it was in a good state last I played it
i also enjoyed the test weekend quite a bit
oh hell yeah thats good to hear
and yeah Ive heard 2042 and vanguard are complete disasters
Im just skeptical of any game's release now
yea ive always been a huge battlefield fan but it looks lackluster and buggy
vanguard is just sweaty and there are like 3 op guns that everyone uses
not super fun
"fucking AAA devs cant release a game in a good state anymore without tons of bugs, server issues and shit"
actually sad
pretty sure its because they already know theyre going to sell and make bank off of it
"EVERYONE downloading Halo Infinite right now, getting basically no download spped"
no need to polish the turd if people will by it anyway
Same..... mine dropped sooooooo low
we in
fuck you
gigabit internet op

rip
"there we go, reset and now I'm up"
my internet is the big poopoo
Should be done when I get done work at like4/5 though
down to clown tonight to see if this is a big turd or actually fun
it's so popular that it broke steam and microsoft
"can't get into a game yet, going to need to wait until later to see if you can play"
missing out. already got a kilimanjaro with an energy sword
"GG @Humes, you just advanced to level 10!"

"yes sir. took me a while to load into a game. thought i was stuck forever on ""waiting for players to load"""
but I got in. played a CTF and control so far
gets hung up on loading map
interesting
havent gotten stuck on that one yet
"says problem with dedicated server, are you on steam?"
yea
"dunno, so weird"
Finally got one! ??????ù˝

You dont need it
Send it to me

this one is even more tight
what the shit....
"only problem with Halo Infinite is that they need to give XP for matches, not just challenges, I'm sure they are looking at everything and thinking about how best to improve all of the functions before launch in a couple of weeks"
They already said they are I think
but just for this beta its whats in place
rather have the game now than wait a month for them to fix it
its also for 6 months.....
so like theres time to fix and still get to 100
"such an amazing surprise with the drop, and it is running pretty smooth"
"by full release, it's gonna be even better, especially with how it is setting all of the records"
yeah game is fun so far
awesome suprise to drop it early
desperately is going to need new maps though..... only 3 for BTB isnt enough
"yeah, once you get all warmed up, gotta hit ranked"
"really like ranked's playstyle, everything is well balanced"
it's very Halo3-esque
I'm like 4 games in I think?  Yeah I like ranked much more than quick play
Excited to see what my ranking will be
Definitely reminiscent of MLG playlist in Halo 3
"so fun to smash some socials though, @DomoYeti and I will probably continue our climb later in ranked solo/duo,"
gotta remember how to play before diving into taht

dark souls always had spells and you could play as a caster if you were severely brain damaged
but they did a huge overhaul onn spell animations and they look sick

rolly dodge boys for life
not like any of this matters for dan
hes going to be a sad army man and not ahve time to play elden ring anyway
YouÉ??ve brought dishonor to the @jmats legacy
idk man sekiro was just a completely different game compared to the other souls
lacked a lot of the personalization like choosing weapons and making builds for replayability
and it was just parry souls the worst kind

Hi friends
How has everyone's weekend been?
@mccmela Official put out some quality Wild West roleplay content in RDR2 yesterday. My Warzone update is about to complete. @burritodp and I need a sherpa for Apex. @BromoYeti and @EverybodyLovesTulio got two gamer stations in one house. I've procrastinated projects and work all weekend by hanging out here. You?
I think @Humes played some Icarus but I didn't see any.
Going to be playing/streaming it for the first time later tonight
been real busy the past couple days
I just picked it up as well
going to see if my computer can run it or not
or if I need to refund
kinda wild MINIMUM is 16GB Ram....Recommended 32
I seriously believe streaming services like GeForce NOW are going to be the future of videogames.
well it doesnt run super good
but its playablwe
so thats good
@burritodp @Humes down to learn the game together later? Seems like my PC can run it ok enough to not need to refund. Still need to work on tweaking setting for optimization
game looks fucking fun though
Sure. Let me know when
"Nice!  I would love to see the VOD for the RDR2 stuff, sounds hilarious.  But work, on weekends?  Eww"
"Weekend was good, we decorated for the holidays"
I wanna check out this Icarus game too
@Humes icarus when?
down for icarus as well
wanna do like 5pm EST?

ATVI can def produce a good trailer
yea the video team is super cool. they are worked to death though lol
my team has meetings with them a lot cause we're all capture artists and they are just constantly grindin
Well they do good work. So is it only going to be vanguard weapons/loadouts in the new mode? Or are they going to mix three gens of weapons into one
"from the trailer it looks like we might get standard battle royale that mixes all, but they also mention vanguard royale which may be locked to just vanguard shit"
theyve previously mentioned that skins and weapons would be useable so I figure thats the deal

"Among Us (coloquially termed ""amogus"") teaches us to punish the minority and hate those who are different and unique as ""impostors."" Instead, I like the breath of fresh air this problem provides as a new perspective on deduction that is not ""red is sus, red vented, etc."" that has been dominating the jokes of my peers and the view of my feed. Yet, by trying to force this problem to conform to ""amogus,"" you yourself are trying to crush originality and uniqueness. Among Us is a game ultimately convincing us to conform to menial labor as ""tasks"" and accept the deal of being just like the rest of the crewmates."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cJpiOPKH14
Couldn't tell you a single thing about what the game is or what its about but the cinematic was cool
Makes me want to download BF2 again and play that ish
that cinematic was sick
Right lol? The dude said the game was in early development. But I just really like the ripped fish people slappin those drums
unfortunately we get sick ass cinematics a lot with games that dont deliver nowadays
This.
Next trailer that dropped was a Wonder Woman game and the live chat was just a fast paced stream of É??LÉ?ùs lmao
lmfao

"Funny, I was thinking about playing BF2 again earlier"
we played it for MAYBE 2 weekends last year back in january and it was stupid fun with everyone
lmao out of curiosity just checked its 90GB

Yeah IÉ??d love to go back and play some more of that.  Gotta prep the gaming laptop with GTFO and Icarus and Halo before I leave for the holidays
Discord is in fact blocked on our NIPR network.  Sadness
tried B2 with friends
shit is pretty tricky. we had it down after 1 wipe but we had a bot that fucked us over by not running with us and dying in a really horrible spot
im hooked game is sick
I also want to try out this more creative/valheim mode in icarus and not the mission based
We cleared that shit by the skin of our teeth
Lol both b1 and that Icarus mission. One day we will get good and not sweat it

Can you play Icarus solo?
or is it co-op only
you can do solo
but you have to be careful with how you choose to spend points in talent and tech tree
cause youll have to get all essential stuff yourself instead of basically having separate roles
gotcha gotcha.  Just wanted to try it out.  Can you run multiple characters at once?
yea
I have one for multiplayer where I have very specific tech tree stuff like no building stuff. More focused on other shit.

I second RobbyÉ??s comment about not buying the exact same second monitor for the same reasons he mentioned

Yup

I couldn't tell what was satire at many points
"Lol everyone they interviewed was an actor or actress. Hugh grant was incredible. 

É??While we were preoccupied fighting amongst ourselves, the coronavirus was bearing down upon us. Now those who have closely studied the history books, such as myself, knew this was strongly reminiscent of the time the white walkers led their armies of the dead towards the warring factions of WesterosÉ?ù"
Big dog
"Or his take on the capitol riots
É??It was shaping up to be a clash of epic proportions. Perhaps the closest historical parallel would be the battle of hogwarts, when lord Voldemort sent his death eaters to attack the school and defend his final horcruxes. Similar to trumps supporters believing the only way to stop the deep state from destroying democracy was to destroy it themselvesÉ?ù"
That dog has cool face markings

I think the nye countdown/pre ball drop coverage is some of the most cringe awful content on TV. Don't @ me.
isnt that common knowledge
why are you watching that garbage?
It's a reflection of what's popular for sure
"I just don't understand it. It makes very little sense to me. Why does it exist? It's just hours and hours of music and advertisements. Why does it exist? People want to be in NYC to watch the ball drop, fine, but other than that....it serves zero purpose"
I don't really like NYE personally so the whole thing is cringe.
Agreed
Return of the King has been synced to midnight since 8:23pm
NYE is the worst holiday
shit is bottom tier

If anyone is ever interested in learning/playing that dominion card game I was talking about I found and online version
https://dominion.games/
what is the card game never heard of it
"So honestly my parents found it, and we've played it a bunch and it's super fun. At least I enjoy it. It's a deck building game but basically you all take turns, each turn has a buy and actions that you can do. There's a bunch of different cards you can buy and in turn draw that change what you can do (more money, take away things from other players, protect you from attack) with the goal of acquiring land(cards that cost a certain amount)"
Easier to play than explain but it's fun

Finally home from all our travels
@jbarnes (toyotathon) I just watched death to 2021
Shit was 1) very funny 2) very very depressing
Agreed
Has anyone seen just look up on Netflix
It's fucking amazing
Very very similar vein to death to 2021
DonÉ??t look up? I watched it. Thought it pushed the agenda a bit too hard and was just a bunch of the very same elite people the movie targeted virtue signaling. Although I did like the end
The sad part is that they didnÉ??t even have to stretch the material to make america seem so awful. Pretty sure they probably wrote half the script through trump and don jr tweets
I think that's why i enjoy it so much. I'm still watching but it feels like a validating experience

well this should be interesting
instead of fixing all their issues internally just sell the company and let someone else handle it?

Activision was bleeding revenue due to being a garbage company for the last 10 years I think. They probably got bought at somewhat of a discount

How else are we going to finance DPCA Fyre Festival?
They only rent to one group at a time so I think it's 44k for the island per day

É??The villas can be rented separately or the whole island can be booked by one single group to ensure complete privacyÉ?ù. Think they rent to multiple groups but at that 44k price point.

Need to get a new headset.  Should i go separate microphone & micless headphone combo?  Or headset with mic? any recommendations?
Not trying to stream or anything like that
I'm a huge fan of using my real headphones and separate mic
If you don't want a stand mic like a blue yeti bullshit there's some good mics you can get that attach to a normal pair of headphones that you can detatch at anytime and make it just a headphone again
I'm currently rocking my audio Technicas which are kinda the industry standard of an intro headphone that you don't need to spend 2k on
They're like less than 200
Then I think I use this antlion mic that just sticks to the side magnetic ally
https://antlionaudio.com/
Dope!  Ty
And for the audio Technicas it's the m50x model. The m50s are the shit for intro/ industry monitor headphone
I'll look into it.  Yeah my desk is kinda small and doesn't have good edges to attach stuff so maybe the magnetic attachable is the way to go
All of this is if you actually care about the audio quality. I'm sure there's some good full gaming headsets you can get
But I use the headphones a ton to listen to music while I work and whatnot
So it's nice to have a dope pair of headphones to listen to music and also use as a gaming headset
If you don't give a fuck at all might be easier just to get a headset
I think I saw on Stephens stream he rocks the audio Technicas
"YouÉ??d think a better quality headphone would just be better overall,  is there something about gaming headsets that make them better for gaming other than L33T looks and RGB lighting?"
built in mic is the only thing I can think of
also most are wireless these days

"Can someone dumb down what a ""Blockchain"" is?"
a block chain is like a big digital accounting book
"and it uses digital signatures (so a certificate that validates authenticity for a single user) and cryptographic hashing (making plaintext stuff seem garbled and random) to validate members of the ""accounting book"" and obfuscate their information"
"So anyone can access it and look at it but unless you have the key to that cryptographic hash for your record, you won't be able to make usable information out of it"
"Hence why it's so problematic when dudes have hard drives with millions of $$ in BTC on it but they lost their key, because the key ""unlocks"" the hash with the usable information (the money)"
Thank you so much! That helps a ton!
"You're welcome, I am currently in a IT security certification and we covered it two days ago so that was a good validation of my understanding of it xD"

Over under on us army boys taking a trip to ukraine?
0% of going to to Ukraine right now. High probability of Russia imploding if it does invade. Only winner in all of this is the CCP.
The Economist has had many great pieces on this topic. Most of the American articles on it have been polarized garbage one way or the other.
https://youtu.be/Z9c_HhpvBpg
So what's the out?
"We have to give Putin an opportunity to save face and ramp down or fall into the abyss. If he invades, the EU will re-arm and NATO will strengthen greatly."
Police action 2.0
Poland might just get the NATO base it desires if he does it.
Honestly overt military action is a sign of weakness at home. Putin's asymmetric and information operations campaign to increase Russia's influence have been working very well. Why not just keep doing that? That's the big question
"Yeah I am somewhat confused, russia has had little green men in Ukraine for half a decade. Why the sudden huge build up?  Legit question"
"Overtly? Momentum, opportunity, policy. Real reason? Who knows? Another insanely complicated topic the Army will just be expected to be highly educated on."
I really would rather not fight an outright lsco with russia
Nuclear weapons mean we haven't and won't
"On a scale of 1-100 how sure are you of that. Because mutually assured destruction aside, all it takes is a spark"
Outright conflict doesn't necessitate nuclear coa's
Classic Cold War question there. Many opinions out there on it. Lots of open source stuff. Plenty of academics have looked at it through the eyes of serious study. It is not a stretch to say that there are most likely studies not a matter of public record.
I agree with the movie wargames: the only way to win is to not play

Hypothetical for you all: say you're stranded on a tropical island and have people requesting medical care but you don't have a corpsman on that island yet so you call the corpsman and he tells you what to give them and you give it to them despite not being a medical professional.

"It's pretty wild how you can't be boozed up at work but you can be super lit on caffeine. In fact, it is encouraged."
So im not sure what to do. I now have an extra secret lab seat back (like literally just the back portion)
"I got replacement because i had emailed secret lab and told them it was broken (sheered screws) but i just backed them out, and went and bought new screws from ace hardware so it is functional now. I looked online to see if you could buy all the components to make a second chair but I wasnt able to find any of the butt seat areas"
Time to build a racing sim chair and get deep into online racing sim oculus culture with me when I get back.
so now i have just a seat back
ooooo fuck
thats not a bad idea
This is what I've been looking at but the complaints are it's just not a real back.

But it's super compact for storage which is what I'm looking for honestly.
Do you think you could screw it to the back of this?
no shit my OPS SGM bought this for the field

Did he share it with you lol?
Or were you just in wonder watching him use it
"@jbarnes (toyotathon) it was for the both of us. Since we were using WAG bags, which covered the entire seat we could share without cross contamination"

"@everyone My boot drive currently has approximately 34.8 GB of temporary files, I am trying to give myself some fuckin space back on that drive because theres no good reason i should have 120 GB of data on my boot drive. My question is that file safe to just delete?"
use disk cleanup
literally go to the start menu and search it
ive done that
The problem with disk cleanup is that it doesnt go through and delete all the bloat
it deletes all the temp files that can be deleted
So long answer is i need 34 gb of temp files??
Why?
The Treesize app im using shows like actual space used and theres a ton of garbage that cleanup isnt finding
your disk defrag been done recently?
I feel like I did it like 2 months ago
"GG @burritodp, you just advanced to level 21!"
and i just checked in
0% frag
hmm. I'd start in safe mode and see if disk cleanup can remove the temp files then
if it didn't remove them it means a application is using them
The disk cleaup checkbox for temp files says zero?
yessir
fucking send it
lol
"also, who doesnt use dark mode?"
Me bitch
you have anything on there you cant just redownload
?
besides my boot drive nah
fucking delete it
see what happens

"@any woodworkers in the chat. Building the desks recommended by @Humer , think im going to get the cherry wood 8 foot and cut it down to make some shelves underneath. Question, finish for the wood, I'd like to use something with a little bit of filler so I dont have shit get caught in the grain, so do I do like a linseed oil with a glaze finish? Or just say fuckit and use cherry danish oil?"
Sand it with a random orbital sander to 200 and then use danish oil
"Wet sand to 1000. Primer, base color, clear coat. Boom, you painted a car."
Etching primer
You forgot to mention bondo all the rust with aprox 30kg of bondo
My coffee table is walnut and cherry. Sanded to 800 and finished with polyurethane. Spilt coffee on it this morning and it was a really easy clean up.
Fuck me 800?
How long did that friggin take
Days and days
Wasn't that a project you did with bread boy? @burritodp there has got to be an NCO in your unit that is way into woodworking. Just buy him/her a six back and get them to help you.
I guess there are no female NCOs in the infantry yet. Him*
Fair point. With how expensive the fuckin wood is I don't want to fuck it up
I'd look at Restore first. They probably have some nice scrap hardwood.
No not bread boy. This was years ago
"I already bought the wood, just looking at advice. It'll take 2 weeks to get here"
I have two books I have recently read through on woodworking and materials for construction if you want me to send them to you
Anything nuggets of knowledge in there worth knowing?

Carm out here flying the rock
"This @mccmela  or AF PAO, Can't tell"
Team. I have 12 lieutenants in the 3 shop. I do not know what to do with this many LTs.
Make each one responsible for a single week on the calendar so they spend all their time handing off planning to each other
Try to make sure they make friends and look out for each other rather than being a bunch of BFers
That and make an ESports team
"Tell them not to buy Toyota Tacomas, trade options, and to make sure they start doing grad school stuff now"
"I disagree with Alex. Tell each of them individually that you heard another one saying they don't belong in the Army because they don't work hard enough. 
1. Drives competition
2. You don't have to worry about them teaming up against you.
3. It'll be fun to watch."
Tell them Ranger school is mostly a waste of time unless you are shooting to be an IN MAJ
"That LSCO knowledge is more important. Grit learned from Ranger seems to be helpful, but it should always be a personal decision to go... Not forced upon you"
Tell them to cross over to the AF
You really can't say that ranger school is a waste of time if you're an infantry captain without a tab. I'd lean in to the toxic masculinity and say that you decided it wasn't worth going once they started letting women in.
"All of my friends who went to Ranger school had a bad time. One lost his relationship, one got injured badly and Med-Boarded, one lost his platoon slot because he was busy at Ranger, one never got a platoon because he failed out twice and wasted 6 months doing it. The list goes on"
Completely agree. But Dan can't say any if that since he doesn't have a tab.
"Oh yeah, another did it enroute so he missed the chance at a GWOT patch"
What's GWOT
Tabs are for pussies
Hot take
Jk
I'm the pussy
That's a way to sum up my argument ????
"I just don't care about it man. I can't bring myself to give a shit about schools anymore. Like I gave a shit about eib but one of the key motivators was ""I never want to have to deal with this again"""
I still think the best thing you can do for you is pit them against each other. You'll get the best products and the most work out of them and have to do little in terms of maintenance of the shop.
@jmats  with the Renegade playthrough
Just the one that makes the most sense for Dan.
"He could, put in long hours, drive them to be successful, inspire them to do well blah blah. But to what end? Getting home late every night? Having no work life balance? Having to spend time motivating 2LTs to do simple tasks or just finding it easier to do it himself? I'm just giving the best answer for Dan. If you want the best answer for the Army I can give that one."
Dang
"Besides, with my recommendation you can still appear benign. You can force them all out of the office at 1700 and give the impression you care about their will being, but it just means you can go home early. You ask them to set deadlines to give you deliverables because they'll always give you a sooner deadline than you need. Just shift the owness to them and hold them accountable to **their** deadlines. You paid back what you owe the military. Let them pay back theirs."
"Treat them like adults. Treat them like Captains, I see it."
Sink or swim
"""Here's the assignment. You can reference similar assignments previously completed using the collaborative tools at your disposal. Give me a deliverable date, you'll brief me your product then. Feel free to ask me any questions via email or in-person at work."""
I actually like that a lot
"One of the biggest problems I have had is trying to get them to not do the bare minimum. Like a project will get done, they'll tell noone, and fuck off for until I notice that they're fucking around."
That's on them though. They have got to be willing to apply themselves or they'll never get a platoon.
Lol. Not true and I wouldn't go that route. Starts to eek towards motivating and S3 shop is not the place to try to motivate people.
Copy and paste this in an email to each one along with an assigned task.
"I'd have one of them go through the sharedrive/SharePoint organize it, upload it to teams and give the rest of them a lesson on how to use it and only accept deliverables through that. No lost files, no excuse to only be able to use GFE, you can monitor progress and push products real time. It's an enterprise solution that has been in the civilian side for a decade and it took COVID to provide it to you."
lol this
Using all of the O365 tools really helps track productivity.
It is absolutely what should be used. Especially for staff work.
"No more ""MASTER_Tracker_FINAL-03OCT18 Copy (2).pdf.xls"" getting to sent to you from a Hotmail account."
Put the McConville work life balance slide in their initial counselings
Big fan of that slide
"Yeah, they just need to know that nobody but them will take a true interest in their career. This is exacerbated post-Command. They are the masters of their own destiny. They define their own success now. Keep learning. Figure out how to use collaborative tools. Set goals and make reasonable daily steps towards reaching them."
"It is a ""What have you done for me lately"" world. Especially in business or when you are, again, post-Command/MAJ/LTC and beyond."
"I guess the last thing to say on this is: give their senior rater some perspective on their potential. They won't get the airtime to actually assess it. When looking at potential for LTs, it's really the small things that matter."
"Make them jerk each other off in the office in a single elimination, March madness style tournament."
Whoever blows first wins.  Winner gets to be your chai boy
Jfc. Give this man a star
Then you're just rewarding the least stamina. Not the most skilled.
Nice!

@burritodp Just a reminder that Elden Ring drops in just over a week. I'm ready for the stream.
"I'm can't tell if you guys are actually going to watch me streaming it, but those games are way more fun talking to people throughout so I am fucking hype"
There's no better video game experience than listening to Dan berating himself after the boss just whooped his ass for the 24th time.

"@ElJeffe honestly we don't really know. It's FROMSOFTWARES first time doing an open world so we're not sure how similar/different it will be from previous dark souls games. As it stands I'd say for games that are currently out on PC from them, DS1 is actually a good intro. The moves are the most telegraphed and has the least amount of bullshit with it"
Combat is apparently close to DS2
Which I played the most
I'm ready
"They have come out and said not to worry about the difficulty but I'm not sure if that means it's easier than others, or if they are just telling the scrubs to get fucked"
Don't start with Sekiro. It ruins the other games because of how much fun the freedom of maneuver and parry system are compared to the dodge on DS or bloodborne
Agreed with @jmats
"Sekiro was very fun but very different from the others,  and if you love that combat system the others aren't similar enough for you to get into them"

Well I don't have a ps5 so it's day one patch or bust if that's true
Walmart is supposed to be having a PS5 drop today
Probably the exact same way our grandparents responded to WWII
All Fromsoftware have been like this. They tie a lot of the physics to framerate clock so you can't go above 60fps.
"Interesting, CD Project Red did the same thing with TW3, only two framerate options"
"With a 3090, you literally have enough GPU to take the entire 40gb of game geometry and render it all simultaneously with ray tracing."
Same reason. All the hair physics and outfits are tied to frame tick. They actually upscaled TW3 to 60fps. On release they only had 30. 2014 was different standards for framerate.

Now
Is it?
I was playing some last night and still looked like endurance was giving me equipment load
Or maybe I was lied to
not sure if that is true
Maybe that was just network test
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/qw13jm/now_that_equip_load_is_tied_to_strength/
Sad
Yeah I think its still endurance
I mean the good news is you still need 100000000 points into endurance in order to dodge more etc
so still works out
endurance > hp
Does it give stamina too or is that seperate stat still
Oh vitality was equipment load before nvm
I think from last night it seemed like endurance is green energy bar and equipment load

I'm trying to talk my self out of the 500 tier....
Today I learned Carm is a Sanderson super fan. I think im going to stop myself at the 160 hardcover tier.
The way I play? Probably not
#DanSouls
I'm a little nerd for Sanderson
Luke hasn't even read Oathbringer!
I havent ???? think I might give up on WoT and get back on the stormlight grind
Big nerd*
I assume you've also read through his Mistborne series Carm?
When do we get to watch Jeff's sadness?
"Yeah those were my first ones, I haven't read through the second age yet tho"
"I loved the first trilogy. Wasnt as big of a fan of the steampunk western 2nd one so much. Still a great read, but just kinda weird not being in a fantasy setting."
Yeah I had a hard time getting into it. I really liked Elantris but Stormlight is my favorite. Maybe even like top of the list in favorite series
I saw Sanderson was a little upset that Martin got to co-write Elden Ring because Sanderson is apparently a big souls fan and played all their games
Yeah I know a lot of people werent huge fans of Mistborne. Stormlight 100% god tier though
"I saw the YouTube lol, he is a big souls fan"
Sanderson the GOAT
"best writer in the business right now, and a huge souls fan. not much to hate"
He's made 21.5mil on the Kickstarter in two days @Dingus
I talked myself out of the big tier and I'm gonna get the ebooks lol
I think I'll get the hardcover ones
"..... Thats actually bonkers, but also super well deserved. That has to be one of the largest kickstarters ever right?"
https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/03/04/brandon-sanderson-kickstarter-is-biggest-ever.html
"And probably for the best, I cant imagine the monthly extra stuff from the 500 is going to be that important. Probably a tshirt or something small each month"
Im a personal fan of hardcover over ebook if its a book I love and know ill re-read so most likely going hardcover ones as well @burritodp
Well there you go! Praise be to Sanderson

"@everyone I have a computer question. My buddy is building a computer and is running into issues. We completely disassembled it, reput it together to the bare minimum. Right now, all that is connected is the cpu to the mobo, his ram, and a m2 drive. 
For connected cables we have from the psu:
The mobo 24 pin
The cpu 4x4 (8pin)
The case header cable to the mobo
And the cpu fan cable"
"The problem were running into is no boot, not even to bios"
"I think the mobo is getting power because front panel indicator light is on, and the back panel had led s that are on"
The actual mobo indicator lights do not turn on however
I'm not sure what the issue is
so this is stupid but when I upgraded my pc a few months back I had similar issue. I was being a dumbass though and my RAM wasnt fully seated into the mobo. just make sure its in the appropriate slots and pushed in all the way cause I think thats an easy thing to mess up
"I thought that too, I'm 99% sure the ram is good, I took it out and pushed pretty hard, checked to make sure it's level"
sweet
another thing worth checking is bios version and cpu support. I luckily didn't have to deal with this but depending on if a mobo was bought used (or an older model) its possible it needs to have the bios updated in order to support the new cpu
if the mobo was bought new i doubt that's the case
"It was bought new, and doesn't answer why zero fans are turning on/why nothing comes up on screen when trying to boot"
what wattage is psu? should be totally fine without a gpu but im curious anyway
delayed boot is a thing too
"he might press the button and nothing happens for a bit, that scared me with my current build"
No boot to bios even?
600watt and not even to bios

Already got more and better patches than Halo Infinite after 6 months ????
Actually depressing how badly they're botching that game
6 months and only what 4 maps? 3 btb that hasn't been playable for 3 of those months
Could legit just copy paste any one of the the 500 old maps and no one would give a fuck. Don't worry though.... In 8 months after release they're adding 2 whole maps to go from 4 to 5 and 3 to 4

Here you go @burritodp on sale today
"Man, like both of you said, he's going to have to rebuild his whole rig to replace the CPU. New motherboard, new CPU cooler, pull off all the RAM and cards... this is like another $1000 easy. Should he do it? Maybe eventually. Is it needed now? Probably not. With gaming, CPU is rarely the bottleneck because of how labor is divided unevenly between processing graphics and counting instances. If he were doing video editing or game building, yes, new CPU is in order. Will he notice an improvement in playing video games with a new CPU? Rarely. I'd just overclock the CPU until you burn it out and then get the new one. 8k series is more than enough for the near term."
That's My concern as well @jmats that I would be future proofing the rig (even more than I am) for a problem that doesn't really exist
My philosophy is typically ride-her-til-she-dies.
RIP Tanja.
"I'd pull up your CPU utilization graph (through task manager or something else) while running benchmarks in the games you play (or just playing them normally) to see how much of your CPU you're utilizing. If it's under your GPU utilization just keep what ya got until that's not the case. Tech is always getting cheaper for CPUs, so replace when you do a rebuild of the whole thing. And then just spend that money instead on more RGB fans or a bigger waifu pillow in the meantime"
No such thing as a wifu pillow that's too big. Excellent point
Or I can just keep spending money for bits to fuck with @Humes while he's streaming
also a valid option

Question: are there more wheels É?®    or doors ???¶  in the world?
"What defines a wheel/door? Does every caster wheel on an office chair count as two separate wheels since it has two distinct load bearing surfaces? Does every PO Box count as a door since it has a frame, hinges, and an opening mechanism?"
"My apartment has many doors. Cabinet doors, fridge door, door doors"
Cars have 4 wheels but also 4 doors
Bikes have two wheels and no doors.
I'm going with doors
"For reference, think about how many Lego wheels there are, hot wheels"
Wheel barrow
Trash bin
Scooter
Golf cart
Infinite wheels
Think of how many office buildings and massive apartments there are around the world though
"With desks that have doors, cabinets etc"
and all the apartment mailbox doors if we consider those
Just Lego makes 381 Million tires A YEAR
Hot wheels makes 519 million A YEAR
519 million Cars that is
This is where my thought process went. That's why I asked about office chairs. For each office door there's at least a few office chairs. most with 6-12 wheels.

"Still though, taking up fighting positions and putting your BSA in a non-safe area is stupid. The residual radiation levels in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone are not sufficient to give anyone ARS. ARS is more like... The Firefighters who tried to put out the fire at Reactor 4 with Water, in front of an exposed core or people within ~2-3km of ground zero after Fat Man/Little Boy (who survived the blast, fragmentation, and thermal energy)."
Chornobyl's residual radiation level is actually at or very near background levels unless you are right up on the sarcophagus
Weird thing I enjoy: Opening up an excel and seeing how someone did or didn't do the background calculations. It's like watching everyone playing Elden Ring. Some @Dingus 's will use the IF statements to exceedingly impressive complexity. Some @jbarnes (toyotathon) 's will use a VLOOKUP and automate the whole document. Some @burritodp 's will just have the calculator app open and put every number in manually. You get this intimate glimpse into how people solve problems.

This is pretty fucking detailed. I'm impressed. It's definitely DoD compliant which sucks cause it limits what you can do. One piece of advice I'd look into is creating a tab that just collects the data as opposed to multiple tabs pulling data from other tabs. It prevents you from having circular references and makes generating new reports super straightforward. I think you could have some Pivot Tables. Those guys fuck.
"New one is sent. The problem I ran into and why I built in an equation tab is to have a presentation tab ""force mod tracker"" that could be printed and given to the boss, and I was struggling to have one long ass equation for each of those items, and it was easier for me to organize my thoughts in a intermediate slide"
"I made it because we were hamstrung w/ trackers during reverse rsoi, and I figured if I could just build a tracker and then tell bde to use what I built. Made it easier"
I'm unfamiliar with pivot tables
Pivot Tables are god tier.

Would anyone be interested in taking a weekend to build a game together?
Did you do that because of the file size?   We did that when I was a BN S6.  S3 wrote all the products on a SIPR standalone computer then we copied it over with an S-MDL to upload to JCR and distributed it there too.  Was actually really helpful since we could push products in the field without having to worry about the companies getting internet access somehow
Yeah it was for us to transfer to jbcp IOT make distro easier. We had a bunch of trouble actually getting it to work but we were committed
"My guy, brilliant stuff. JCR/JBCP is way more survivable and less jammable too. STT does have the advantage of low power transmission because of the huge gain antenna so it has a relatively small ELINT signature, but it is still a radiating: ""Kill my entire staff"" beacon"

Swelling is about the same. New sores opened up though. I'm thinking maybe scurvy.
Pics or gtfo
What the fuck.... That bug bite you were talking about is giving open sores.
Fuck that noise
So what kind of peg leg are you going to get?
A nice mahogany or cherry wood peg leg?

Someone get my boy some medical assistance
"Fun Fact: The local populace, and most of Southeast Asia, use Betel Nut. Its a relatively strong psychoactive. They put it in their lip like dip in the US. However, absorption through the lining on the mouth is not that great so they also carry a bag of Lye (Potassium Hydroxide) around to apply to their gums prior to chewing Betel Nut. Potassium Hydroxide is used in tissue digestion (i.e. how they disposed of bodies in Breaking Bad). So the Lye eats away at their mouths over time and leaves their teeth exposed all the way down to the roots."
We are building a Dental Clinic.
Isn't betel nut also bright red so it dyes the shitnout of your teeth?

You need to switch to Arduino Nano Every to get it to flash.
What about adding leds that flash when someone pays the spray fee. People will see his response but most likely not the water and it would alert them more?
This thing sprays a lot of water.

@burritodp i made you dis
one thing I'm thinking of is my headphones. I recently got new ones and dont want them to get soaked and destroyed in the event I experience a lot of spray
I know the sprayer has more of a stream mode though which may be the moves so I dont just mist everything a bunch. Gonna have to be careful with positioning though in that case cause if im moving my head around a bunch it could probably miss pretty easily
Just use mineral oil so it won't short your electronics ????

@everyone I fell down a Raspberry Pi rabbit hole. Does anyone have any projects they want to do with a Raspberry Pi? Give me what you want to do and I'll generate the list of materials for you to buy and work through the programming and setup with you.
Some example projects:

https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-golf-robot (literally launch your golf clubs out of your bag using voice commands)
Do you have a project that could make me forget being at work

Raspberry pi arcade and plant watering system
I installed Retropie on one and installed a library of hundreds of NES/arcade games and it was pretty straightforward
Pi with a mic array to categorize and locate sounds. It would be kinda cool to leave in a forest and locate different animals
Basically just a ShotSpotter for birbs
Or a smart birdhouse that has a camera and identifies birds!

Last suggestion for Pi stuff: check out the Pico microcontroller. They're sick
That's what @Humes got. the Nano Every just has a different chip.
