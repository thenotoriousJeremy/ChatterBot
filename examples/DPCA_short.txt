Legend says santa is bringing me lvl 3 tomorrow
I hear papa personal is the one that brings levels to children that weren't good but weren't bad enough to be called naughty
Dan ban him. We cant allow this cheating
Papa Personal will protect me

Only genuine leveling
I made many sacrifices to papa personal

"Also, love living near Seattle because there's like a 25% chance that things on amazon have same day delivery"
Ofc papa personal blessed him with good sleeps
Papa personal saw into his sould by giving him a tug on his ear lobe. He saw he was a mediocre boy and deserved a good night's rest

that dude came into the disc hot
Fuck that dude

Level 5 grind today
where is my level at MEE6
I don't understand the levels. Is it tied to the wow accounts?
Nope
Papa personal grant me lvl 5
What do the levels do?
They are an indicator of the favor of our lord and savior papa personal
Kyle has upset papa personal clearly
Papa Personal has not abandoned me
"Papa personal sent me a dream last night. He said unto me, his only begotten son, ""Kyle has strayed from my light, he doth not follow the ways of the righteous, he hath smol pp"""
It is true
Who is this?
Who is papa personal?
Papa personal is in all of us
Makes more sense than Christianity. I'm in.
Where do I send my tithings?
Tiths?*
Wow gold. Exclusively.
What's the conversion currently?
Sent direct to dem Arby's boys g bank
safer investment than the dollar
"currently the conversion is about 130,000 gold to $15"
Churches expect 10% of your income at least right?
Depends on your specific religion
that's what tithe means
10%
Oh. TIL
I didn't know that either
!rank
Yeet
What does that mean??^^
"GG @jmats, you just advanced to level 2!"
Fuck you.
It means I am papa personals chosen
"In my church growing up they taught that you should budget using 80-10-10 financial plan. 80% of your income goes to rent, food, utilities and other necessities; 10% goes to the church as your tithe; and 10% goes to a savings or investment account for retirement"
"GG @Deathtrap69420, you just advanced to level 4!"
Honestly thats a better financial plan than I got
that being said - most religion is a huge grift
Mainly Christianity.
What a fantastic scam
Idk man I believe in god
I agree the majority of followers are blind pawns
Since fucking when?
Made to make money for the church
the whole churches don't have to pay taxes was a fantastic move by the religious in this country
Agreed kyle
like how tf do they not have to pay taxes
and how do I get that privelege
Bout 2 years jeremy
Still no a fan of organized religion
since 'nam
Not*
To each their own.
Fuck you lol
I wonder if i can make that a ban-able phrase
Nah. If you found god and it benefits you. Cheers.
